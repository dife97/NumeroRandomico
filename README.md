# NumeroRandomico

This simple app is a game where the user has 3 tries to match a random number generated by the system. The only tip the app gives is if the typed number is greater or smaller the random number. 

Developed with: 
- VIP;
- Clean Architecture;
- UIKit Programmatically (ViewCode).

It was developed in my mentorship with [DevPoli](https://www.devpoli.com/).
